# Fraud Detection


## General info

The project concerns the anomaly detection in credit cards transactions using machine learning models and Autoencoders. 
The main aim of this project is predict whether a given transaction was a fraud or not.  The analysis includes data analysis, data preparation and creation model by using Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, Support Vector Machine (OneClassSVM) algorithms and autoencoder model.

### Dataset

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in two days in 2013 by European cardholders and contains frauds as well. It comes from Kaggle and can be find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
